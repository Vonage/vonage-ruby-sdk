* Added support for Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) Request: https://developer.nexmo.com/api/verify#verifyRequestWithPSD2
* Introduced strict typing to more SDK classes

# 7.0.0

**Major Release with Breaking Changes**

* Renamed the `Calls` class to `Voice`

  This is a backwards incompatible change.

* Raise exceptions for any error responses in the `NumberInsight`, `SMS` and `Verify` API classes

  This change eliminates the need for users to build custom error handling for error responses
  that come as part of a `200 OK` API response in the legacy APIs.

  This is a backwards incompatible change.

* Added support for additional environment variables

  Support has been added for:
    * `ENV['NEXMO_APPLICATION_ID']`
    * `ENV['NEXMO_PRIVATE_KEY']`
    * `ENV['NEXMO_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH']`

* Added type checking for Account and Alerts APIs

# 6.3.0

* Added `api_host` and `rest_host` config options

  Use these options to override the default hostnames:

      Nexmo.configure do |config|
        config.api_host = 'api-sg-1.nexmo.com'
        config.rest_host = 'rest-nexmo-com-xxx.curlhub.io'
      end

* Added type checking for SMS API

# 6.2.0

* Upgraded zeitwerk dependency to version 2.2 or newer

* Fixed authentication for Redact API method

* Fixed ruby 2.7 deprecation warnings

# 6.1.0

* Added support for newer signature methods

  Use the `signature_method` config option or the `NEXMO_SIGNATURE_METHOD`
  environment variable to specify a different signature method:

      Nexmo.configure do |config|
        config.signature_method = 'sha512'
      end

* Added support for error responses with description keys

# 6.0.1

* Fixed Nexmo::Conversations#record method to use the correct path

# 6.0.0

* Dropped support for older rubies

  **Required version is now Ruby 2.5.0**

* Added Nexmo.configure method for global configuration

  Use `Nexmo.configure` to specify config options globally:

      Nexmo.configure do |config|
        config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
      end

  Alternatively use the Nexmo::Client#config attribute to set config options on a per client basis:

      client = Nexmo::Client.new
      client.config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

  Nexmo::Client objects can still be constructed with a hash of config options as before.

* Added Nexmo::Conversations#record method for recording a conversation

* Added zeitwerk dependency to handle constant autoloading

* Changed `Nexmo::Applications` to use Application API v2 (potentially backwards incompatible)

# 5.7.0

* Added support for [Conversation API](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/conversation)

# 5.6.0

* Added support for [US Short Code 2FA API](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/sms/us-short-codes/2fa) (thanks @dusty)

* Added simplecov for measuring code coverage

# 5.5.0

* Added http options

  This makes it possible to configure the underlying net/http connections for
  things like timeouts, proxies, and SSL certificate settings. For example:

      client = Nexmo::Client.new({
        http: {
          read_timeout: 5,
          proxy_address: 'localhost',
          proxy_port: 8888,
          ca_file: 'certificate.pem'
        }
      })

* Added Nexmo::Client#api_key= method

* Added Nexmo::Client#api_secret= method

* Fixed `client.numbers.list` to support calls without any arguments

# 5.0.0

* Dropped support for Ruby 1.9

* **(breaking change)** API methods are now namespaced

  For example: `client.calls.list` instead of `client.get_calls`

  For example: `response.messages.first.status` instead of `response['messages'].first['status']`

* **(breaking change)** Renamed Nexmo::Client `key` option to `api_key`

* **(breaking change)** Renamed Nexmo::Client `secret` option to `api_secret`

* **(breaking change)** Renamed `Nexmo::JWT.auth_token` method to `Nexmo::JWT.generate`

* Param keys for the SMS API and Conversion API are now hyphenated for you

  For example: `status_report_req: 1` instead of `'status-report-req' => 1`

* Param keys for the Number API are now camelcased for you

  For example: `voice_callback_type: 'app'` instead of `voiceCallbackType: 'app'`

* Added new methods for update call actions (hangup, mute, unmute, earmuff, unearmuff, and transfer)

# 4.8.0

* Nexmo::Client :key and :secret args are now optional

  If you're only making calls to the Voice API you can now instantiate a client object with just an application_id and private_key. For example:

      client = Nexmo::Client.new(application_id: application_id, private_key: private_key)
